Bill runs a fast food hamburger restaurant, and sells hamburger meals.
His meal orders are composed of three items, the hamburger, the drink, and the side item.
Application lets Bill select the type of burgers, and some of the additional items, or extras, that can be added to the burgers, as well as the actual pricing.

You need a meal order. This should be composed of exactly one burger, one drink, and one side item.
The most common meal order should be created without any arguments, like a regular burger, a small coke, and fries, for example.
You should be able to create other meal orders, by specifying different burgers, drinks, and side items.

The drink should have at least a type, size and price, and the price of the drink should change for each size.
The side item needs at least a type and price.

Every hamburger should have a burger type, a base price, and up to a maximum of three extra toppings.
The constructor should include only the burger type and price.
Extra Toppings on a burger need to be added somehow, and priced according to their type.

Create a deluxe burger meal, with a deluxe burger, that has a set price, so that any additional toppings do not change the price.
The deluxe burger should have room for an additional two toppings.

Create a default meal, that uses the no arguments constructor.
Create a meal with a burger, and the drink and side item of your choice, with up to 3 extra toppings.
